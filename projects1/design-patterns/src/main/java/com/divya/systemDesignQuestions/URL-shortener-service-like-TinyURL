URL Shortener service
        A URL shortener service creates a short url/aliases/tiny url against a long url.
        Moreover, when user click on the tiny url, he gets redirected to original url.

        Tiny url are handy to share and use. its easy and less error prone to type.

        EX: Long URL: https://medium.com/@sandeep4.verma
            Short URL : https://tinyurl.com/3sh2ps6v

1. Functional Requirements:
* Service should be able to create shortened url/links against a long url
* Click to the short URL should redirect the user to the original long URL
* Shortened link should be as small as possible
* Users can create custom url with maximum character limit of 16
* Service should collect metrics like most clicked links
* Once a shortened link is generated it should stay in system for lifetime

2. Non-Functional Requirements:
* Service should be up and running all the time
* URL redirection should be fast and should not degrade at any point of time (Even during peak loads)
* Service should expose REST APIâ€™s so that it can be integrated with third party applications

3. High-level design
